## WeCollect 📱

**WeCollect** is a mobile application developed to track product prices in stores, with the goal of making shopping easier and helping users save both time and money.

The project was created as a response to rising inflation and frequent daily price changes on the market.

## 🧠 Idea

WeCollect solves a simple yet everyday problem –
**Where is a product the cheapest?**

Unlike applications that rely on official retailer data, WeCollect is community-driven. Users manually add products, prices, and store information, creating an up-to-date and dynamic database.
